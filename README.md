# Digit-Sense-
A Hand Written Digit Recognition Model that can classify digits from 0 to 9 using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.The model is trained and evaluated on the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing).

The core of this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is highly effective for image classification tasks. CNNs automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features such as edges, curves, and textures, making them well-suited for recognizing handwritten patterns. The network architecture includes convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for final classification.

Key Highlights

Data Preprocessing: Normalization and reshaping of images to improve training efficiency.

Model Training: CNN-based architecture trained using TensorFlow/Keras for accurate classification.

Performance: Achieves high accuracy in predicting handwritten digits from unseen test data.

Visualization: Includes training progress plots (loss and accuracy) and prediction samples.

Applications

This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning in automating digit recognition tasks. It has real-world applications in:

Banking – automating cheque processing.

Postal Services – recognizing handwritten zip codes and addresses.

Education & Data Entry – digitizing handwritten forms and documents.

Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

This project serves as an excellent introduction to deep learning, CNNs, and computer vision, and can be extended further to handle more complex handwriting datasets or integrated into real-time recognition systems.
